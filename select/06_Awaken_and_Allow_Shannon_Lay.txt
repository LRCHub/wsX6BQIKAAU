I sit here quiet fingers folded
Holding something i can't see
I must not fear what comes tomorrow
I must not dream of yesterday
I'm harboring a deep compassion
Slowly it is what i keep
I watch it grow, from far, from close
Awaken the nature that is me

I have to get out of California
The days go by like smoke in the wind
Oh to grow
Oh to discover
The nature without the nature within

I am so still i feel the earth turning
The moon falls slowly into place
Do not resist new forms are calling
They patiently await embrace
Do not stop change in favor of comfort
A bud cannot resist to bloom
The more i learned the less i knew
Allow the nature that is you

I have to get out of California
The days go by like smoke in the wind
Oh to grow
Oh to discover
The nature without the nature within
